Sponsor Invitation
Financial sponsorship of the conference is a	way to give back to the R community. In so doing, your organization will gain visibility among prominent statisticians and in the large R user base. Funds from sponsors will be used to enhance the conference, e.g. to provide scholarships for participants who would otherwise be unable to attend, to help fund the social aspects of the conference, etc.
